# 311 Poster

This is a toy I built so I wouldn't have to check the [Grand Forks 311](http://www.grandforksgov.com/online-services/gf-311)
app/website all the time.

It currently toots to Mastodon at [@hackgfk_311@botsin.space](https://botsin.space/@hackgfk_311).
Toots are converted to Tweets ([@hackgfk_311](https://twitter.com/hackgfk_311)) with @renatolond's wonderful 
crossposter: https://crossposter.masto.donte.com.br ([source code](https://github.com/renatolond/mastodon-twitter-poster)).

Written in R because I'm much quicker at that than Python, and it seemed like a fun use case.

Pull requests always welcome!

# Hack Grand Forks 

I named the repo something general because I'd like to add more tools/bots in the future to help get 
people engaged in this type of thing. If you have any ideas or would like to contribute to a grander 
"Hack Grand Forks" idea, [open an issue](https://github.com/mattbk/hack-grand-forks/issues) and we can talk.
